# Crystal-Helper
This is a mini project bot I'm working on as part of me learning more about [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/). Essentially a "helper" bot that will be capabale of getting doc information, code samples and evaluating code, all written in Crystal. :D

I would recommend not using the bot right now as it's in really early stages and is a learning project more than a production project. The code is open-source for people that also want to learn Crystal this way or want to correct my (currently) bad Crystal code.
